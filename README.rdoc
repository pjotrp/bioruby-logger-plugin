= bio-logger

This is a plugin for sane handling of errors and exceptions in different
situations:

# Normal user
# Developer
# Web server
# Fault-tolerant systems

bio-logger builds up on log4r functionality, using a more fine-grained
approach for logging errors. I.e. within 'info', 'warn', 'error' an addition 
value 1..10 can be set to limit output and logging.
